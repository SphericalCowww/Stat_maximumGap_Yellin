# Using Yellin's Maximum Gap Method to Estimate the Upper Count Limit of a Gaussian Signal Distribution under Various Background Distributions from scratch

The code runs on python3 with additional packages:

    pip3 install scipy
    pip3 install tqdm
    ./macroRunOrderRef.sh
With the PYTHONPATH set correctly for `macroRunOrderRef.sh`. However, even then the above with take days to run, `macroRunOrderRef.sh` is more of a reference to guide the order of the python codes to run.
    
`mergePickle.py`: helper code for merging two pickle files to avoid having to run through the entire for loop (see `macroRunOrderRef.sh`) for each output reference pickle files.

`uniTransSampling.py`: example code for inverse transform sampling to understand "distributed uniformly with unit density" to describe Eq.2 in Yellin's paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0203002">arxiv</a>).

`maxGapDistrGen.py`: Monte Carlo code that generates the probabily distribution $P(x, N, J)$: the probability of sampling $N$ points in a uniform distribution $y \in [0, 1]$, such that the maxium gap distance is $x = y_2 - y_1$ for any two points $y_1 < y_2$ among the $N+2$ points including the boundary 0 and 1, such that there are $J$ other points $y_i$ in between $[y_1, y_2]$. The output is saved in `pickle/maxGapDistr.pickle` for reference by the later codes. Turn on "testMode = True" to check out the code's functionality. This code is the most time consuming piece of the method, but it only needs to be done once.

`maxGapDistrDisp.py`: displaying the gap distribution $P(x, N, J)$ generated by `gapDistrGen.py`. The code output the following figures:

- Right: one of the 10M Monte Carlo sample from uniform distribution $y \in [0, 1]$ with $N=10$.
- Left: $P(x, N, J)$ for $J=0$, whose analysical form given by Eq.A4 in Yellin's is shown as the red curve.

- Right: one of the 10M Monte Carlo sample from uniform distribution $y \in [0, 1]$ with $N=10$.
- Left: $P(x, N, J)$ for $J=5$, which no longer has an analytical form.
    
`maxGapOptIntAlpha.py`: obtaining $C_n(x, \mu)$ from $P(x, N, J)$ generated by `gapDistrGen.py` by averaging over Poisson distribution (akin to Eq.A5 in Yellin's). Then Monta Carlo a given signal distribution with a given signal count $N_{sig}$ is used to find $C_0$ and $C_{max}$. In this case, the signal distribution is assume to be a known Gaussian with $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$. The output is saved in `pickle/maxGapOptIntAlpha.pickle` for reference by the later codes including $\alpha = 0.90, 0.93, 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, 0.98$.
