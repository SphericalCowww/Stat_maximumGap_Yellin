# Using Yellin's Maximum Gap Method to Estimate the Upper Count Limit of a Gaussian Signal Distribution under Various Background Distributions from scratch

The code runs on python3 with additional packages:

    pip3 install scipy
    pip3 install tqdm
    ./macroRunOrderRef.sh
With the PYTHONPATH set correctly for `macroRunOrderRef.sh`. However, even then the above with take days to run, `macroRunOrderRef.sh` is more of a reference to guide the order of the python codes to run.
    
`mergePickle.pyy`: helper code for merging two pickle files to avoid having to run through the entire for loop (see `macroRunOrderRef.sh`) for each output reference pickle files.

`uniTransSampling.py`: example code for inverse transform sampling to understand "distributed uniformly with unit density" to describe Eq.2 in Yellin's paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0203002">arxiv</a>).

`gapDistrGen.py`: Monte Carlo code that generates $C_n(x, \mu)$ in Yellin's paper. The output is saved in `pickle/maxGapHists.pickle` for reference by the later codes.

`gapDistrDisp.py`: displaying the gap distribution generated by `gapDistrGen.py`.
